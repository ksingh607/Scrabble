      <p style="margin-top:10px; padding-top: 40px;">
        Scrabble, the renowned word game, was invented by Alfred Mosher Butts in 1938. Initially called
        "Criss-Crosswords," Butts carefully crafted the game by <br><br>calculating
        letter distribution and point values based on English language frequency. However, it struggled to gain
        commercial success. In 1948<br><br>, entrepreneur James Brunot partnered
        with Butts to refine and market the game, renaming it "Scrabble." The game gained popularity in the 1950s
        and<br><br> 1960s, becoming known for its strategic gameplay and
        language skills. Scrabble tournaments emerged in the 1970s, and the first National Scrabble<br><br> Championship
        was held in 1971. Today, Scrabble is played in over 120 countries
        and has numerous special editions, spin-offs, and digital adaptations.
