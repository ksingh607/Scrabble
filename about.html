            <p>My name is Kiratpreet Singh, and I'm a student at Seneca College. I'm currently enrolled in the Computer
                Programming and Analysis (CPP) course, where I'm honing my programming skills and learning various
                programming languages. Originally from India, I've always been fascinated by technology and software
                development.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When it comes to games, Scrabble is my all-time favorite! I've always had a love for language and
                wordplay, and Scrabble perfectly combines my passion for words with my strategic thinking skills. I
                enjoy the challenge of creating words on the game board using letter tiles with different point values
                and maximizing my points by leveraging the game's rules and strategies. As a student of computer
                programming, I find Scrabble to be a mentally stimulating and engaging game that hones my
                problem-solving skills.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To create my digital version of Scrabble, I researched the game's rules, history, and strategies using
                resources like Wikipedia.</p><br>
            <p>Honesty Statement: <br>
